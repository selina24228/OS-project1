# OS-project1

This is the project for OS, 2019 spring.
In this project we try to build a user-level schedular.

## Design and Architecture
We use a three-leveled architecture.
1. main process
2. schedular process
3. task(event) process
----
### Main process
read input form stdin, and maintain a table for all information about all tasks.

### Schedular process
### Task(event) process
